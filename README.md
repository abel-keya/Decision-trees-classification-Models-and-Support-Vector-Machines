# Description

>
Part 1: Decision trees:

- Boosted Decision Tree models that makes the above prediction. 
* Random forests,
* Ada boosted trees,
* gradient boosted trees.
- optimization of each of the the above models to Identify the best model, and used the best model to determine which features are most impactful in influencing the prediction

Part 2: SVM:

- The project code applies Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build the SVM model and then evaluates their performance and then  pick the kernel that performs the best. 
- the best kernel is  used with tuned parameters and  additional features.
